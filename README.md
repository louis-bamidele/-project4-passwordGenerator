## about the project
- Passwords that are strong are unique and random.
- Humans arenâ€™t very good at coming up with passwords that are either of those things, let alone both. Therefore, I have developed a Strong Password Generator that will generate secure and memorable passwords for you. 81% of data breaches are caused by reused or weak passwords, so random, unique passwords are your best defense against online threats.

- why should i use a password generator
- If you use the same password for both your email account and your bank account login, an attacker only needs to steal one password to get access to both accounts, doubling your exposure. If you've used that same password for 14 different accounts, you're making the attacker's job very, very easy. To protect yourself, you can make sure you create unique passwords that are easy to remember by using a password generator.
